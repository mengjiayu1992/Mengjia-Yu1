# Java Algorithms and Data Structures Projects

This repository showcases several classic algorithm and data structure implementations in Java. Each file represents an individual programming assignment or concept I completed during my studies in computer science.

## ðŸ§  Contents

- **HuffmanCoding.java**  
  Builds a Huffman encoding tree from character frequencies using a priority queue. Demonstrates greedy algorithms and tree traversal.

- **Main.java**  
  Entry point or combined test driver for other classes.

- **Search-1.java**  
  Implements search algorithms such as linear and binary search. Highlights conditional logic and iteration.

- **SimpleKnapsackDemo.java**  
  Solves the 0/1 Knapsack problem using dynamic programming. Demonstrates optimization and space-time tradeoffs.

- **TowerOfHanoi.java**  
  Recursive solution to the Tower of Hanoi puzzle. Illustrates stack-based thinking and recursion depth.

## ðŸ”§ Technologies

- Language: Java
- IDE: IntelliJ IDEA / VS Code
- Concepts: OOP, Recursion, Greedy Algorithms, Dynamic Programming, Search Algorithms, Trees

## ðŸ“š Purpose

These programs were written as part of coursework in **Data Structures and Algorithms** and related computer science subjects at Montclair State University. They serve both as a personal study archive and as demonstrations of problem-solving skills.

## ðŸ“‚ How to Run
